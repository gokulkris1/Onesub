Database Design & Implementation:
Choosing a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, or a BaaS like Supabase/Firebase).
Designing the database schema (the actual tables, relationships, indexes, constraints) to store users, providers, services, bundles, subscriptions, payments, etc.
Setting up and configuring the database instance.

API Development (Server-Side Logic):
Writing the code for API endpoints to handle all application logic:
Authentication & Authorization: Secure user registration, login, password management (hashing, resets), and role-based access control.
User & Provider Management: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user profiles, provider details, onboarding workflows.
Bundle & Service Management: Logic for admins to create and manage bundles and services.
Subscription Logic: Handling subscription creation, renewals, cancellations, status updates.
Payment Gateway Integration (e.g., Stripe): Securely processing payments, handling webhooks from Stripe for payment confirmations, managing customer and subscription objects in Stripe. This is a critical and complex part.
Dashboard Data Aggregation: Backend logic to query the database and prepare the specific data needed for each dashboard (user's subscriptions, provider's revenue, admin's platform overview).
Notification System: Integrating with an email service (SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES) to send actual emails based on application events.

Security:
Implementing security best practices on the backend: input validation, protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection), secure API key and secrets management.

Deployment & Infrastructure:
Setting up a hosting environment for the backend API and database.
Configuring web servers, load balancers (if needed), and other infrastructure components.
